This has been causing lots of problems for A&eth;albrandr when he goes on dates. When he heard that Cornell has a Machine Learning class, he asked that we help him identify the gender of a person based on their name to the best of our ability.  In this project, you will implement Na&iuml;ve Bayes to predict if a name is male or female. </p>\n",

This button will send any code below surrounded by <strong>#&lt;GRADED&gt;</strong><strong>#&lt;/GRADED&gt;</strong> tags below to the autograder, which will then run several tests over your code. By clicking on the <strong>Details</strong> dropdown next to the Submit button, you will be able to view your submission report once the autograder has completed running. This submission report contains a summary of the tests you have failed or passed, as well as a log of any errors generated by your code when we ran it.\n",

Furthermore, <em>any code not surrounded by <strong>#&lt;GRADED&gt;</strong><strong>#&lt;/GRADED&gt;</strong> tags will not be run by the autograder</em>. However, the correctness of your implementation -- not the autograder's output -- will be the final judge of your score.  If necessary, we will review and grade assignments individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your work.\n",

    "<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else's code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don't try.
